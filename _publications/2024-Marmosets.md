Gastrointestinal diseases are the most frequently reported clinical problems in captive common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), often affecting the health and welfare of the animal and ultimately their use as a research subject. The microbiome has been shown to be intimately connected to diet and gastrointestinal health. Here, we use shotgun metagenomics and untargeted metabolomics in fecal samples of common marmosets collected before, during, and after a dietary transition from a biscuit to a gel diet. The overall health of marmosets, measured as weight recovery and reproductive outcome, improved after the diet transition. Moreover, each marmoset pair had significant shifts in the microbiome and metabolome after the diet transition. In general, we saw a decrease in <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Prevotella</i> species and an increase in <i>Bifidobacterium</i> species. Untargeted metabolic profiles indicated that polyamine levels, specifically cadaverine and putrescine, were high after diet transition, suggesting either an increase in excretion or a decrease in intestinal reabsorption at the intestinal level. In conclusion, our data suggest that <i>Bifidobacterium</i> species could potentially be useful as probiotic supplements to the laboratory marmoset diet. Future studies with a larger sample size will be beneficial to show that this is consistent with the diet change.
