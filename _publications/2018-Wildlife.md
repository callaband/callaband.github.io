title: "Wildlife-microbiome interactions and disease: exploring opportunities for disease mitigation across ecological scales."
collection: Perspective
permalink: /publication/WildlifeMicrobiome
excerpt: 'In this perspective, we examine how the microbiome influences gastrointestinal disorders, metabolic dysregulation, reproduction, and disease susceptibility in captive wildlife. Investigation of wildlife, and specifically captive wildlife, affords a unique opportunity to gain understanding of the broad diversity of the associated microbiota and learn from nature’s molecular and microbial responses to disease.'

<u>Highlights</u>:
    • Wildlife microbiomes are underexplored and may contain valuable information for animal and human health.
    • Captive wildlife are susceptible to various diseases with explicit or purported links to the microbiome.
    • Gastrointestinal disorders, metabolic dysregulation, reproduction, and disease susceptibility in captive wildlife are reviewed.
    • Captive wildlife viewed as model systems provide an opportunity to observe diverse functional roles of microbiota in both disease and health states.
    • Host–microbe interactions present in wildlife populations can potentially lead to new biotherapeutic treatments.
